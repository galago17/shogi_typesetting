\imgmed{``The Attack Rolls in Like a Sudden Tide''}{diagram1}

Though I elected not to play in this season (season 10) of the TT-Series, I did so with an interesting intent. In fact, I wanted to focus on writing about the games and making a column on them. This is the first game I chose. It's from the first round of the tournament in the Masters' section (just below the top section) ``TTM''.

The players are both individuals who I've known for quite some time. Gosttone (2-Dan), Sente in this game, plays the second board on Guatemala's World Shogi League team.

Tuelyp (1-Dan) is also a very strong player, especially as of the past few weeks, and is a Twitch streamer. I think she should be promoted to 2-Dan in the coming days.

\colpara{Gote is somewhat faster to castle, almost finished with Half-Mino or else with some kind of 3-Move Castle. Sente's shape is very balanced and could become many different things.}

\noindent Gote has many options to continue from this position. Most natural may be to continue castling.
